;lab10.bin: Computes the sum of all positive numbers in a given array stored in memory.
;Fetches initial address / location of array[0]
;Checks if number is positive or negative. 
;If positive, adds the number to the sum. If negative, moves to next element in array.
;Program ends after checking every element in the array given.

;R2 acts as a counter for the number of elements that still need to be checked in the array.
;R3 holds the address of the number being evaluated in the current loop cycle
;R4 holds the value specified by the address given by R3
;R5 holds the sum of all positive numbers that have been computed.
